# Book Keeper

This is an app for browsing the books available in the Gutendex API ([https://gutendex.com](https://gutendex.com)), with the options of performing searches, browsing books in different categories and in different languages, setting up a list of favourite books, and also a reading list with status tracking.

To find books, use the search bar above for a simple search, or navigate using the drop-down menu to "Advanced Search" where options for categories and languages are included.

Also available are lists of books in given categories (see the drop-down menu to go straight to a category), and for books in other available languages.
